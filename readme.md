<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

Metamorphosis provides a simple, straight-forward implementation for working with Kafka inside Laravel applications.

<a name="requirements"></a>
## Requirements

- PHP >= 7.1
- [Kafka Driver](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka)
- [Kafka PHP Extension](https://github.com/arnaud-lb/php-rdkafka)

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

**Important:** *Make sure that you already have installed the OS driver for kafka, and the kafka php extension.*


You can install the library via Composer:

```
$ composer require leroy-merlin-br/metamorphosis
```

And publish the config file with:

```
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Metamorphosis\MetamorphosisServiceProvider"
```

## Quick Usage Guide

### 1. The Config: `config/kafka.php`

The config file holds all information about brokers, topics, consumer groups and middlewares.

To quickly start using, we can focus in two sections:
- Brokers

    An array of brokers, with connection and authentication configurations:

    - `connections`: *required*. can be an `string` with multiple connections separated by comma or an `array` of connections (as `string`)

    - `auth`: *optional*. out of the box, the package can connect with SSL Authentication only or without any authentication

    ```php
      'brokers' => [
          'price-brokers' => [
              'connections' => 'localhost:8091,localhost:8092',
              'auth' => [
                  'protocol' => 'ssl',
                  'ca' => storage_path('ca.pem'),
                  'certificate' => storage_path('kafka.cert'),
                  'key' => storage_path('kafka.key'),
              ],
          ],
          'stock-brokers' => [
              'connections' => ['localhost:8091', 'localhost:8092'],
              'auth' => [], // can be an empty array or even don't have this key in the broker config
          ],
      ],
    ```

- Topics

    An array of topics configuration, such as the topic name, which broker connection should use, consumer groups and middlewares.

    Here we can specify the group consumers, each topic can have multiple groups, 
    and each group holds the configuration for which consumer, offset and middleware it must use.

    ```php
      'topics' => [
          'price-update' => [
              'topic' => 'products.price.update',
              'broker' => 'price-brokers',
              'consumer-groups' => [
                  'default' => [
                      'offset' => 'initial',
                      'consumer' => '\App\Kafka\Consumers\PriceUpdateConsumer',
                  ],
              ],
          ],
      ],
    ```

### 2. The Consumer:
    
After setting up the required configs, you need to create the consumer, which will handle all records received
from the topic specified in the config.

Creating the consumer is easy as running the following command: 
```bash
$ php artisan make:kafka-consumer PriceUpdateConsumer
```
This will create a KafkaConsumer class inside the application, on the app/Kafka/Consumers/ directory

There, you'll have a handler method, which will send all records from the topic to the Consumer,
also, methods will be available for handling exceptions

```php
use App\Kafka\Consumers\PriceUpdateConsumer;
use Metamorphosis\TopicHandler\Consumer\AbstractHandler;
use Metamorphosis\Record;

class PriceUpdateConsumer extends AbstractHandler
{
    public $repository;

    /**
     * Create a new consumer topic handler instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct(Repository $repository)
    {
        $this->repository = $repository;
    }

    /**
     * Handle payload.
     *
     * @param Record $record
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function handle(Record $record): void
    {
        $product = $record->getPayload();

        $this->repository->update($product['id'], $product['price']);
    }
}
```


### 3. The Runner

Now you just need to start consuming the topic.

The simplest way to see it working is by running the kafka:consume command along with the topic name
declared in the topics config key:

```bash
$ php artisan kafka:consume price-update
```

This command will run in a `while true`, that means, it will never stop running.
But, errors can happen, so we strongly advice you to run this command along with [supervisor](http://supervisord.org/running.html),
like this example below:
```bash
[program:kafka-consumer-price-update]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /var/www/default/artisan kafka:consume price-update --offset=earliest --timeout=-1
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=root
numprocs=6
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/var/log/default/kafka-consumer-price-update.log
```

That's it. For more information about usage, middlewares, broker authentication, consumer groups and other advanced topics, please have a look at our [Advanced Usage Guide](docs/advanced.md).
